Debugging

Edit the following lines to list two things you learned about debugging (a command, a technique, a concept. etc.). This is a "for-credit" exercise, I will not evaluate what I consider "difficult enough", I just want to know you learned or practiced two things about debugging.

1. `target create` command is used to specify and load an executable file (the target) into the debugger. This command allows you to set up the debugging environment for a specific program before running or debugging it.
2. If want to know or learn a certain debugger command, I can use `help` to list out the explanations for all commands.
