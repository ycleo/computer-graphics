# Part 1 - C++ Introduction 

# Description

For this portion of the assignment you are going to do a 'follow along exercise' to get up to speed on the C++ programming language. You will submit a screenshot of your completion of the video course so I know you have some preparation to move further.

It's important that you are able to use the C++ programming language throughout this course -- so in order to do so, I have prepared a video course for you to get up to speed.

## F.A.Q.

1. Question - Why do I have to sign up for this? Can't you just give us a written assignment?
    - There is an [./Archive](./Archive) of the previous version of the assignment if you prefer to read some of the details on C++..
    - I think the video format is better -- you can also see how I fix mistakes.
    - In the past, I used lynda.com (now linkedin learning) which was decent, but I could not really confirm if someone watched the videos.
2. Question: - Do I have to do the PPM loader and debugging exercises? 
    - Yes, you will still complete part 2 and part 3 according the the specifications in those portions of the assignment.
    - The wonderful thing is, if you watch the videos, all will be revealed to you.
3. Question: - How should I follow along the videos?
    - Type as I type, experiment, try things out, and experiment.
    - Just watching the videos on 2X will not be enough to absorb material, it's important to perform *active learning* by trying the examples.
