# Part 1 - C++ Quick Start

# Description

For this portion of the assignment, you are going to do a 'follow along exercise' to practice getting started with C++. You **should** watch all 4 videos, even though the deliverable only requires the first part.

These exercises will help you get started with C++ in the class. Note, that this is just a lightweight introduction to help you understand the different pieces of a C++ program.

## Video 1

* Please watch the video here: [C++ Quick Start Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvv0ScY6vfd-R9N-vIDXdd4HO9IYATIxJ)
	
### Your deliverable	
	
* Fill in the [./src/main.cpp](./src/main.cpp) file.
	* The goal is to have similar code to the end of the first video. 
	* You can deviate if you like, but I would like to see [.data()](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector/data), [.size()](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector/size), and [.push_back](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector/push_back) in your code so I know you know how to use std::vector.	
	
## Video 2

This video will help you understand the structue of C++ source files (i.e. header(.hpp or .h) and source(.cpp) files)

## Video 3

This video will be particularly helpful later on in your assignment(s) when it comes to understanding parsing.

## Video 4

This video will help you understand the basics of how memory works in C++. C++ is a general purpose programming language that allows you low level access to memory. Understanding that there is a difference between 'stack' (e.g. local variables), and 'heap' memory (objects that live a long time with 'new') is important.
