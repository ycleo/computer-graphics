# README

- Type out each of the examples from the prevous part.
- **Note** During the start of the semester is usually when you have plenty of time and are ahead of the game. Don't just copy and paste the examples. Type them in, pause if you don't understand anything (search on google, then ask on piazza), play around with the examples, and take this time to learn the basics of C++.
- Do not commit the binary file(prog) to your repository, only the code.
