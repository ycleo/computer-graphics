> "Help, I'm getting error: "Unsupported architecture arm64". Is anyone else getting this?

The above message might be common, and it may be frustrating, but it's example of something we cannot easily help you with.

## How to ask for help

Some tips in order for us to help us help you as fast and as efficiently as possible.

1. Don't procrastinate.
 
Waiting until the deadline puts stress on you and the course staff. When the assignment is released, at the very least, read the assignment within a day or two--even if you cannot start it immedietely. This will help you start organizing information, understanding what types of problems to expect, and provide context to other piazza posts you may passively see.

2. Do Read Piazza

Doing a quick search in piazza may help you save time and energy to see if a question has been previously answered.

3. Do Write a Detailed Piazza post

If your question has not been answered on piazza:

- Write what you have tried
- Paste a full error message (or screenshot with as much detail as possible)
- Note your operating system and other software/tools used.

If we don't have this information, then we're essentially guessing.

4. Do Google.

You're unlikely the first to have encountered any of the errors that may have been encountered.

5. Do link your repository and push your code

Your repository is private, we can then access your code and see what you exactly what you have changed (and what you may have updated in the time before we answer your question).

6. Do not e-mail me with **URGENT!!!!** at 11:00pm on the day the assignment is due.

Instead, create a piazza post describing your problem (using the guidelines above), and use a late token. Try to slowly then break the big and urgent problem into smaller pieces. Then get rested, take care of yourself, and then approach the problem again. Sometimes stepping away from the problem for a few minutes can help clear the mind (That's why it's important to start early!).
